      <h2 class="About">About My Books</h2>
      <p>These are my attempts to create believable and beautiful worlds. I’ve loved fantasies since I was little (mostly ones containing dragons) and now it’s time to make my own. Please give my creations a chance and I’ll do my best to live up to expectations!</p>

      <p>The series I’m currently working on, called The Evolution of Magic, takes place in a world which has never seen anything as extraordinary as magic. That is, until the power begins creeping steadily from the vast forest known as the Green Sea. It warps nature into strange and deadly beasts, and it causes suffering in the ordinary folk of the Blackwood Kingdom. Jacob Enbane, a simple hunter until his village is burned to the ground, must survive long enough to save the land from becoming engulfed in destruction.</p>
